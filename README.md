# COVID-19 Data Exploration Project

## Overview

This project involves the exploration and analysis of COVID-19 data using SQL queries. The dataset used is sourced from [Our World in Data - COVID-19 Deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). The main objective is to gain insights into various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including total cases, deaths, vaccination rates, and their relationships.

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Selection:** Initial exploration involves retrieving and understanding the structure of the COVID-19 dataset, focusing on relevant columns and filtering non-null continents.

2. **Initial Data Exploration:** A closer look at specific columns such as location, date, total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population to establish a baseline understanding of the data.

3. **Likelihood of Dying:** Analyzing the likelihood of dying if contracting COVID-19 in certain locations, with a focus on total cases and deaths.

4. **Percentage of Population Infected:** Examining the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19 over time.

5. **Countries with Highest Infection Rate:** Identifying countries with the highest infection rates compared to their populations.

6. **Countries with Highest Death Count per Population:** Exploring countries with the highest death counts per population.

7. **Continent-wise Death Count:** Analyzing continent-wise death counts to understand regional impacts.

8. **Global Numbers:** Providing an overview of global COVID-19 numbers, including total cases, deaths, and death percentages.

9. **Total Population vs Vaccinations:** Investigating the relationship between total population and vaccination rates.

10. **Creating a View:** Establishing a view named "PercentPopulationVaccinated" to store data for later visualizations.
